    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>From grades six through twelve, I attended the Ursuline School in New Rochelle, New York. It was there that I discovered my love for computer science. Throughout my senior year of high school, I took courses at the Flatiron School in lower Manhattan to continue learning about computer science as well as develop my coding skills. I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. </p>
